Dear PPG Recruiter,

Sorry for not attending the interview I scheduled with you. I understand that this is a violation of my Student Responsibilities. I ended up wasting your time and neglecting this opportunity you have provided. My actions reflect poorly upon myself and the entire Carnegie Mellon institution. This is not acceptable behavior, and I would like to formally apologize.
